**Markup**

- Styled using bootstrap CDN
- Globals.css overides defaults where applicable
- Content is written using EJS to inject dynamic values (where applicable)

<hr>

**NOTE(s)**

- While it is possible to mix dynamic and static markup: (for example, is it neccessary to have hero as `.ejs` ? I could just as easily write this in the plain html) I thought it best to keep the project as close to production code as possible.
